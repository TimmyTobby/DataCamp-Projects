{"cells":[{"source":"## 1. DRY: Don't repeat yourself\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_1234/img/survey.png\" style=\"float: center;\" alt=\"A pictogram of a blood bag with blood donation written in it\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<p>Have you ever started your data analysis and ended up with repetitive code? Our colleague Brenda who works as a Product Analyst, has found herself in this situation and has asked us for some help. She's written a script to pull Net Promotor Score (NPS) data from various sources. NPS works by asking <em>How likely is it that you would recommend our product to a friend or colleague?</em> with a rating scale of 0 to 10. Brenda has set up this NPS survey in various ways, including emails and pop-ups on the mobile app and website. To compile the data from the different sources, she's written the following code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"py language-py\"># Read the NPS email responses into a DataFrame\nemail = pd.read_csv(\"datasets/2020Q4_nps_email.csv\")\n# Add a column to record the source\nemail['source'] = 'email'\n\n# Repeat for NPS mobile and web responses\nmobile = pd.read_csv(\"datasets/2020Q4_nps_mobile.csv\")\nmobile['source'] = 'mobile'\nweb = pd.read_csv(\"datasets/2020Q4_nps_web.csv\")\nweb['source'] = 'web'\n\n# Combine the DataFrames\nq4_nps = pd.concat([email,mobile,web])\n</code></pre>\n<p>This results in the DataFrame <code>q4_nps</code> that looks like this:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th><code>response_date</code></th>\n<th><code>user_id</code></th>\n<th><code>nps_rating</code></th>\n<th><code>source</code></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>2020-10-29</td>\n<td>36742</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>email</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2020-11-26</td>\n<td>31851</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>email</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2020-10-27</td>\n<td>44299</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>email</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>…</td>\n<td>…</td>\n<td>…</td>\n<td>…</td>\n<td>…</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This code works, but it violates the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) programming principle. Brenda repeats the same code for email, mobile, and web, except with different variable names and file names. While it's often quicker to copy and paste, it makes it easier to introduce errors. For example, if you need to edit one of those lines, you have to do it in multiple places. Enter functions! Repeated code is a sign that we need functions. Let's write a function for Brenda.</p>","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"],"collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false,"source_hidden":false}},"id":"ab68c5d4-8f85-4a26-9ad7-095bbea6867b","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"#

Verifying the files with the \"with\" keyword\n<p>Excellent, we have a function that reads and cleans Brenda's CSVs precisely the way she needs! She can call this function in the future for as many different sources as she wants. Before we combine the NPS DataFrames, we want to add a function that verifies that the files inputted are valid. Each of these NPS dataset files should have three columns: <code>response_date</code>, <code>user_id</code>, <code>nps_rating</code>. Previously, Brenda would check this manually by opening each file. </p>\n<p>Let's write a function that uses the <strong>context manager</strong> <code>with open()</code> so that we properly close the files we open, <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files\">even if an exception is raised</a>. If we don't use the <code>with</code> keyword with <code>open()</code> , we would need to call <code>close()</code> after we're done with the file. Even then, it's risky because an error might be raised before the <code>close()</code> functions are called. </p>\n<p>The function will return <code>True</code> if the file contains the right columns. Otherwise, it will return <code>False</code>.

Breaking down NPS by source\n<p>Is it good to have an NPS score around 10? The worst NPS score you can get is -100 when all respondents are detractors, and the best is 100 when all respondents are promoters. Depending on the industry of your service or product, average NPS scores vary a lot. However, a negative score is a bad sign because it means you have more unhappy customers than happy customers. Typically, a score over 50 is considered excellent, and above 75 is considered best in class.</p>\n<p>Although our score is above 0, it's still on the lower end of the spectrum. The product team concludes that majorly increasing NPS across our customer base is a priority. Luckily, we have this NPS data that we can analyze more so we can find data-driven solutions. A good start would be breaking down the NPS score by the source type.

Adding docstrings\n<p>Interesting! The mobile responses have an NPS score of about -15, which is noticeably lower than the other two sources. There are few ways we could continue our analysis from here. We could use the column <code>user_id</code> to reach out to users who rated poorly on the mobile app for user interviews. We could also breakdown NPS by source and date to see if there was a date where NPS started clearly decreasing - perhaps the same time there was a bug or feature realeased. With the functions we created, Brenda is in a good place to continue this work!</p>\n<p>The last thing we'll discuss is docstrings. In Task 1, 2, 4 and 5, we included docstrings for <code>convert_csv_to_df()</code>, <code>check_csv()</code>, and <code>categorize_nps()</code>. However, we should include docstrings for all the functions we write so that others can better re-use and maintain our code. Docstrings tell readers what a function does, its arguments, its return value(s) if any, and any other useful information you want to include, like error handling. There are several standards for writing docstrings in Python, including: <a href=\"https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html\">Numpydoc</a>, <a href=\"https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html\">Google-style</a> (chosen style in this notebook), and <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0287/\">reStructuredText</a>.</p>\n<p>To make sure Brenda and other colleagues can follow our work, we are going to add docstrings to the remaining undocumented functions: <code>combine_nps_csvs()</code>, <code>calculate_nps()</code>, and <code>calculate_nps_by_source</code>. It's up to you how you want to write the docstrings - we'll only check that a docstring exists for each of these functions. </p>","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"52"},"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"],"collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false,"source_hidden":false}},"id":"a15d42a0-79c9-414b-b80a-a549492a8c69","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Copy and paste your code for the function from Task 3\ndef combine_nps_csvs(csvs_dict):\n    \"\"\"  verifies that the CSVs are valid and another that converts them into the DataFrame format \n    \n    Args:\n        csv_dict (dict) : A dictionary containing the CSV's name and source type will be the key and value, respectively\n        \n     Returns:\n        DataFrame: The concatenation of the df from different sources\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define combine as an empty DataFrame\n    combined = pd.DataFrame()\n    # Iterate over csvs_dict to get the name and source of the CSVs\n    for name, source in csvs_dict.items():\n        # Check if the csv is valid using check_csv()\n        if check_csv(name) is True :\n            # Convert the CSV using convert_csv_to_df() and assign it to temp\n            temp = convert_csv_to_df(name, source)\n            # Concatenate combined and temp and assign it to combined\n            combined = pd.concat([combined, temp])\n        # If the file is not valid, print a message with the CSV's name\n        else:\n            print(f\"{name} is not a valid file and will not be added.\")\n    # Return the combined DataFrame\n    return combined\n\n# Copy and paste your code for the function from Task 6\ndef calculate_nps(df):\n    \"\"\" Calculate the NPS score using the nps_group column \n    \n    Args:\n        DataFrame (O): Dataframe python object\n    \n    Returns:\n        nps (float) : nps scores\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the NPS score using the nps_group column \n    nps = (len(df[df['nps_group'] == 'promoter']) -
